## Introduction

- The document 'explores the concept of nothingness as [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c), particularly in the context of Japanese philosophy, with references to thinkers such as **Nishitani Keiji**, **Karatani Kojin**, and **Takeuchi Yoshimi**, who famously stated that "[Japan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2750285d-0078-452a-b3d8-696b26b2cbcf) is nothing".

- The idea of "Japan is nothing" is not meant to be essentialistic or racist, but rather to highlight the non-dualistic and non-essentialistic metaphysical stance of Japan, which is based on the non-duality of substance and insubstantiality, contrasting with the European metaphysics of self-understanding that prioritizes being over nothingness.

- Japanese philosophy is characterized as nihilistic, reflecting the idea of absolute nothingness, and is influenced by Buddhist thought, which emphasizes the concept of nonsubstantiality, or groundlessness of Being, and the idea that reality is empty, or void of permanent substantial being.

- The concept of nothingness in Japanese philosophy is not unique to Japan, but is shared with other cultures in the Buddhist sphere of influence, including [India](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/50d80b34-f410-49aa-80bc-dcb32be8e75c) and [China](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c11edf9f-67d4-4d27-a424-8e145be1489c), and is also reminiscent of pre-dualistic, pre-Socratic Greek philosophy and the naturalistic religions of animistic, shamanistic tribal cultures of early [Europe](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/aa33cb41-0192-4856-887e-89fdb89df8ac).

## The Influence of Buddhist Metaphysics on Japanese Thought

- The influence of Buddhist metaphysics on Japanese thought is profound, with even "vulgarized" forms of Buddhist metaphysics influencing everyday people within the cultural domain of [Japan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2750285d-0078-452a-b3d8-696b26b2cbcf), much like "vulgarized" Christian metaphysics influences people who speak European languages.

- The document also references Western thinkers such as [Martin Heidegger](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cda04228-d065-48e0-ab44-477f29883fae), [Louis Althusser](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/ff69e980-fc56-453f-99d0-513bbf27d0b5), and [R.D. Laing](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/06b8a4c8-29c8-4a48-8676-2d719ba334b6), who have written about the concept of nothingness and its relationship to being, self, and society, highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of this idea across different cultural and philosophical traditions.

- The concept of the Western Self is described as a substantial, self-constructed Being, whereas the Japanese mind is characterized as a non-constructed Nothingness, influenced by Buddhist and Daoist philosophies, such as śûnyatâ and wu wei.

## The Concept of Nothingness in Japanese Philosophy

- The [Kyoto School](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9b95dabd-a65f-48c7-956c-b6510ad3de6c) philosophy, represented by thinkers like Nishida and Nishitani, is often seen as typical of Japanese philosophy, emphasizing nothingness and anti-essentialist ontology, which is also associated with [Zen](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/33462721-ac22-4cd1-8765-9a7d88f4bef4) [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a6d31634-6ad7-47bc-9ede-d986f8f1229e), meditation, and aesthetic sensibilities.

- Japanese thought has always been influenced by various foreign philosophies, including Marxism, Feminism, Post-Colonial Studies, and [Deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/03dbf60b-4152-4bd2-a0ac-efc04b34ec80), as well as historical influences from German philosophers like Hegel, Nietzsche, and Heidegger, and Chinese thought, particularly [Confucianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/86aaddcc-2ff9-4fe1-bba4-bd3ad99a0664) and Buddhism.

- Despite importing foreign ideas, Japanese philosophy has assimilated and domesticated them, retaining its ancient beliefs and traditions, as noted by the example of Japanese intellectuals rejecting idealist or nihilist denials of the ordinary world of sense experience when embracing Buddhism.

- The Japanese philosopher Itô Jinsai is cited as an example of down-to-earth aesthetic sensibility, who mocked world-denying idealism by questioning the concept of emptiness, and his rhetorical question can be answered by pointing to the transience-permanence of all things, which is a key aspect of traditional Japanese thought.

- Traditional Japanese thought is characterized by its anti-metaphysical foundation, which combines philosophies of nothingness with a life-affirming immanence, and is often associated with the concept of silence, where immanence becomes void, or the void is immanent, and nothingness takes place.

## The Kyoto School Philosophy and Its Emphasis on Nothingness

- The text also warns against the dangers of exoticism, citing an example of Western-Orientalist paternalistic language, which can be misleading and problematic, and emphasizes the importance of understanding Japanese philosophy on its own terms, rather than projecting Western assumptions or expectations onto it.

- The concept of "Japanese identity" being "affirmed" or "received" by others is problematic, as it implies a form of national essentialism and egalitarian utopia, which is not supported by the idea of a global, trans-national world.

- The writing style of authors such as Blocker and Starling perpetuates "the myth of Japanese uniqueness", a concept also known as "reverse Orientalism", where they romanticize and exoticize [Japan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2750285d-0078-452a-b3d8-696b26b2cbcf), attempting to explain "Japaneseness" as a distinct way of life or thinking.

## The Influence of Foreign Philosophies on Japanese Thought

- The authors' approach to understanding Japan is flawed, as they are trying to "transcend" their non-Japaneseness and achieve a state of "silence" or "nothingness" that is perceived as exotic and desirable, rather than acknowledging it as an actual aspect of Japanese culture and philosophy.

- In contrast, Japanese philosophers such as Nishida and Karatani have developed a radical and effortless "self-[deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/03dbf60b-4152-4bd2-a0ac-efc04b34ec80) of the self", where nothingness is not just a concept, but a transcendental reality that dissolves the ego, and this perspective is rooted in the idea of "the self-awareness of absolute nothingness".

- The Japanese perspective on nothingness differs significantly from the Western view, where nothingness is often seen as a challenge to be overcome or a state to be achieved, whereas in Japanese philosophy, it is a fundamental aspect of existence that dissolves all standpoints, immanent and transcendental.

## The Concept of 'Japanese Identity' and Its Problematics

- The differences in how Japanese and Westerners view nothingness highlight the role of cultural education in shaping human experience and generating meaning through language and conversation, and demonstrate that metaphysical assumptions can influence various aspects of human life, including psychology, ethics, aesthetics, and the arts.

- According to Japanese philosophers like Nishitani, Takeuchi, and Heisig, the concept of nothingness is central to Japanese philosophy, and it is this perspective that sets Japanese thought apart from Western philosophical traditions, resulting in a unique and distinct approach to understanding the world.

- The Cartesian legacy has significantly influenced the way human experience is organized and interpreted in Western countries, while the Buddhist legacy has a similar function in [Japan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2750285d-0078-452a-b3d8-696b26b2cbcf), shaping the country's cultural and philosophical landscape.

## The Western Self and the Concept of Deconstruction

- Critics of these legacies, including feminists, deconstructionists, modernists, and postmodernists, have sought to challenge the patriarchal and metaphysical assumptions ingrained in these traditions, with the understanding that it is difficult to escape one's cultural upbringing.

- The author believes that [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a6d31634-6ad7-47bc-9ede-d986f8f1229e) is a less "harmful" religion than Christianity and more relevant to contemporary society, but acknowledges the need for a thorough feminist, modernist, and materialist critique of Buddhist metaphysics as a system of domination, escapism, and oppression.

- The concept of "Being as Nothingness" in Buddhism is seen as a promising idea that can help move beyond the self-attachment and [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c) inherent in Western philosophy, and the author suggests that a combination of Western and Eastern metaphysical outlooks could lead to a new program that re-imagines ourselves and our place in the world.

- The author highlights the importance of engaging in partnership dialogue with other traditions without resorting to mystification or exoticization, recognizing that our differences are largely epigenetic and linguistic/semiotic.

## The Philosophers Nishitani and Karatani

- The essay will focus on two major Japanese thinkers of the 20th century, Nishitani Keiji and Karatani Kojin, who have made significant contributions to Japanese philosophy, with Nishitani belonging to the [Kyoto School](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9b95dabd-a65f-48c7-956c-b6510ad3de6c) of philosophy and Karatani being a prominent figure in contemporary Japanese thought, known for his concept of the "Parallax" perspective.

- The author notes that Karatani's influence in the West has been growing, with his book "Transcritique" being praised by scholars like Slavoj Zizek, who has also appropriated the concept of the "Parallax" perspective in his own work, demonstrating the increasing relevance of Japanese philosophy in global intellectual discourse.

- Karatani and Nishitani are two Japanese thinkers who, despite their vastly different backgrounds and perspectives, share a common goal of critiquing Western philosophy, with Karatani being a left-wing, post-war, Marxist radical and Nishitani being a right-wing, pre-war conservative.

- Although they appear to be polar opposites, with Karatani being a secularist and materialist, and Nishitani being indebted to [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a6d31634-6ad7-47bc-9ede-d986f8f1229e) and spirituality, they both offer a fundamental Japanese intervention into orthodox Western philosophy, dealing major blows to the Western philosophical tradition by appropriating certain aspects of it while maintaining a critical distance.

- The thought of Karatani and Nishitani combines into a self-deconstruction of Western philosophy from within, with Karatani's [deconstructionism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/03dbf60b-4152-4bd2-a0ac-efc04b34ec80) and Nishitani's analysis of Western [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c) both targeting the perspective of the Western Self and the metaphysical transcendental subjectivity of the Western mind.

## The Concept of 'Parallax' and Its Significance

- Despite their differences, Karatani and Nishitani share a critical stance, with their thought being influenced by a non-dualistic ontology of Being-Nothingness, as well as a reading of Western anti-metaphysical philosophers such as Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Derrida.

- The Japanese cultural perspective, with its unique blend of Buddhist and Confucian ideas, offers a critical window into Western philosophy, allowing for a de-centred and outsider's perspective that can transform the critical outside of Western reason into an internal critique.

- The influence of cultural background and shared past on ways of thinking is a key factor in understanding the thought of Karatani and Nishitani, with even secular thinkers like Karatani being influenced by Buddhist and Confucian ideas, and Western thinkers like Heidegger being influenced by Christian themes.

## The Critique of Western Philosophy from a Japanese Perspective

- The section from the document 'LEHNAN-3' discusses the critique of the Cogito/Subject/Self from a Japanese philosophical perspective, which arises from the cultural dialogue between Eastern and Western influences in Japan's recent history, as seen in the works of thinkers like Nishitani and Karatani.

- Japanese philosophers have sought to reconcile the "Oriental" and "Occidental" aspects of their country's history, resulting in projects like Karatani's "Architecture as Metaphor" and Nishitani's "The Self-Overcoming of [Nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c)", which offer a unique perspective on the concepts of Structure, State, Self, and Object.

- The comparison between Nishitani and Karatani is not meant to claim that one is a Buddhist or deconstructionist in disguise, but rather to argue that their philosophical projects represent a non-violent, constructive "clash of civilizations" that occurs when two metaphysical systems come into contact and dialogue.

- The next chapter will explore the Western Self and the concept of [deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/03dbf60b-4152-4bd2-a0ac-efc04b34ec80), in order to understand what nihilism is annihilating, and will examine the Western philosophical tradition to criticize it, using the works of Karatani and Nishitani as a guide.

## The Concept of Nihilism and Its Self-Overcoming

- The chapter on Nishitani will be the longest, as his analysis of nihilism is crucial to understanding the difference between Western and Eastern conceptions of Nothingness, and will explore how the Western Self is a "self-split" schizophrenic non-wholeness, which the philosopher must heal by unwinding the self-contradiction of the Western self.

- The role of the philosopher is compared to that of a therapist, who must have the plasticity to transpose themselves into another view of the world, and draw on their own psychotic possibilities to understand the patient's existential position, in order to understand the metaphysics of Western subjectivity and its relationship to Nothingness.

- The section concludes by highlighting the need to understand the difference between "nothingness" in the Western and Eastern traditions, and suggests that this understanding can be achieved by exploring European modernity and the Western cogito, and by discovering nothingness as the hidden core of deconstruction, [existentialism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), structuralism, and [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined).

- The Western mind is characterized by a metaphysical tradition that constructs the self as a solid entity, where "I AM" equals Being, but this self is always encountered with nothingness, leading to [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), which is the experience of the "Abyss" of the World.

- In the Western tradition, nothingness is not seen as absolute nothingness, but rather as relative nothingness, something that we have a relationship with and that "speaks" to us, and this is evident in the concept of angst, which is the experience of the ontological difference between [being and nothingness](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined).

## The Western and Eastern Perspectives on Nothingness

- The Western mind struggles with the concept of existential freedom, which appears as a bottomless, absolute nothingness of Being, and this experience of groundlessness is seen as a painful, frightening, and violent force that threatens the ego or self, as discussed by philosophers such as Heidegger, Barthes, Kristeva, Derrida, and Lacan.

- In contrast, the Oriental metaphysical tradition, particularly in [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and Japanese culture, views the experience of nothingness or "ego-death" in a more positive and calm manner, where nothingness is seen as a pervasive non-force underlying all experience, and the concept of self is not essential or permanent.

- The Western self is driven by a desire to maintain itself and assert its existence, even if it means becoming "nothingness" itself, whereas in Japanese culture, there is no wish to maintain the self, and the self is seen as non-existent, as noted by Takeuchi Yoshimi and Karatani Kôjin.

- The Western mind relies on metaphors of force, power, elasticity, and will power to understand its relationship with nothingness, as evident in the writings of Aki-Mauri Huhtinen, who discusses the importance of being something, but also being elastic to the strangeness that does not conform to determined efforts to be something.

## The Concept of 'Will to Architecture' and Its Relation to Western Culture

- The concept of [existentialism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) in the West is characterized by a sense of guilt and anxiety about not being able to find one's essential self, whereas in Buddhism, this concept is alien, as the self is seen as having no essence or permanence, and the focus is on accepting and understanding the impermanence of all things.

- The concept of nothingness is presented as a superior interlocutor, a grand non-existing otherworldly God-power that punctures reality, and human efforts to reach it are in vain, yet this drives individuals to try harder to get closer to this notion of nothingness, which is equivalent to the concept of God.

- The Christian-Platonic-Western heritage is built upon the Self-World divide, where the Self is constructed over the Non-Self, and this Self is the anti-nothingness, standing in opposition to the concept of the inexistence of nothingness found in Buddhist and Japanese aesthetics.

- The Western mind posits the concept of "positive negative", where nothingness is seen as something, and this is exemplified in the Derridean concept of différance, where the Self transforms the negative power of nothingness into a God-like formal principle.

## The Deconstruction of Western Metaphysics

- The encounter with nothingness during [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is turned into a real battle of substances, where the Self, attempting to overcome its role as a socially conditioned entity, encounters Nothingness as a necessary obstacle to expanding its horizons, and Nothingness represents the limits of Being, exerting a counterforce of negation.

- According to philosophers like Heidegger, human existence is perpetual being-towards-death, and freedom to death, and nothingness, as Nihility, is the power of active negation, which must be overcome for Being to become whole or complete, but this ultimately reveals the absence of its own foundation.

- The Western Self, as the will-to-architecture, reaches for Being but reveals instead Nothingness, and this is the truth of Being, where difference opens up as the ever-present chasm in the centre of Being, which is a concept that is central to post-Christian Western metaphysics and psychology, including postmodernism, [deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), and [existentialism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined).

- Ultimately, nihilism crystallizes and exemplifies the attitude towards the human being, where the Self sets its sights on nothingness, actively fighting it to steal its power of ultimate deconstruction, and the Self desires to become as nothing, as noted by philosophers like Karatani, who writes that the will to construct a solid edifice ultimately reveals the absence of its own foundation.

- The Existential Self strives to become all-encompassing Will by "sucking" or "imbibing" the powers of nothingness, aiming to become a state of pure self-transcendence, as described by philosophers like Nietzsche, who referred to himself as "dynamite".

## The Concept of 'Zero Sign' and Its Significance

- The self's attempt to combat nothingness in the name of Being leads to a perpetual self-division, a rift in the heart of humanity, as it tries to reinvigorate and expand its security as a "Self-standing-over-Nothingness" through a process of self-transcendence and revaluation of all values.

- However, this pursuit of nothingness is futile, as nothingness is nowhere to be found, and the self ends up staring at its own reflection, while true "positive nihility" - the power of Otherness, Difference, Totality, and transcendental consciousness - is relegated to the background.

- The Western existentialist and deconstructionist perspective, as seen in the works of thinkers like Nietzsche, Heidegger, Lacan, Derrida, Bataille, Deleuze, and Badiou, emphasizes the importance of embracing anxiety, desire, and lack, and continuously self-overcoming nihility by establishing a ground of Being, even if it is unstable and self-differing.

- In contrast, Japanese "metaphysics" assumes nothingness as the starting point, without the need for self-preservation or the Will-to-Architecture, and views nothingness as the source of everything, allowing for a non-confrontational relationship between [Being and nothingness](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), as seen in the thought of Indian, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese philosophers.

- This Orientalist perspective, which operates from an unarticulated standpoint of nothingness, is used by thinkers like Karatani to deconstruct the Western logic of architecture, offering a unique insight into the nature of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and the human condition, and allowing for a deeper understanding of the self and its position in the world.

## Karatani's Critique of Western Philosophy

- The text discusses the ideas of Karatani Kojin, a Japanese philosopher, and his 1995 book "Architecture as Metaphor: Language, Number, Money", which analyzes the concept of the "will to architecture" and its relation to Western culture and thought.

- Karatani argues that the "will to architecture" is unique to Western culture and does not exist in [Japan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), where deconstructive forces are constantly at work, allowing postmodernism to blossom in its own way.

- The concept of [deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is introduced through the allegory of Blocker and Starling, who describe it as a force that eats away at the foundations of Western metaphysics, much like microbes devouring a giant cadaver.

- Deconstruction is associated with the lineage of philosophers such as Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Derrida, and is seen as a key aspect of postmodernism, which challenges the traditional logocentric tradition of Western thought.

- However, the text also suggests that deconstruction is not a completely new or oppositional force, but rather a continuation of the project of overcoming metaphysics, and is closely related to [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), as both involve a critique of transcendental egoism and established values.

## Nishitani's Concept of 'Standpoint of Emptiness'

- Karatani's work is seen as being in agreement with Derrida's perspective, and he is described as an "orthodox Derridean" who chooses to be a subject of and as difference, rather than a subject with a capital S.

- The text also mentions Nishitani, another Japanese philosopher, who specializes in nihilism, and suggests that [deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and nihilism are two sides of the same coin, both involving a critique of established values and a self-understanding of modern nihilism.

- Overall, the text explores the complex relationships between Western and Japanese philosophy, deconstruction, nihilism, and postmodernism, and highlights the ways in which these concepts intersect and inform one another.

- The concept of deconstruction in Western philosophy, as explained by Karatani, is the process of undermining metaphysics, de-stabilizing systems, and un-grounding all grounded being, which ultimately reveals the absence of its own foundation.

- Deconstruction is a self-created process, where the attempt to create something out of nothing only highlights the nothingness, and the construction of an edifice reveals the groundless ground of Being-Nothingness as the source of all structure.

## The Kyoto School Philosophers and Their Perspectives

- Karatani's idea of nothingness, void, absence, and difference is central to his analysis, and he draws parallels between [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and Platonism, as well as atheism and Christianity, to illustrate the complexities of these concepts.

- The will-to-architecture, a concept inspired by Paul Valéry's idea of poiesis, or "making," signifies the desire to create something out of nothing, and this process is always in excess of structure, resulting in a surplus that has some relation to nothingness.

- According to Karatani, the Western mind operates in a mode of will-to-architecture, which is the desire to "make" something out of nothing, and this process is self-limiting, as it requires the annihilation of nothingness to make room for being.

- The construction of being is the result of the annihilation or denial of nothingness, and the architecture of the system, self, state, and structure is based on the lie that being can exist without an understanding of nothingness.

- The Western self, as a stable "me," is based on the annihilation of self-difference, and the denial of the fact that the self is divided between [being and nothingness](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), which is a fundamental aspect of human existence, according to Karatani's analysis.

## The Concept of Nihilism and Its Implications

- Karatani's concept of self-[deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) suggests that the attempt to create a solid foundation ultimately reveals the groundlessness of being, and that the self is always already divided, as it is the place of both being and nothingness.

- The concept of self-division is maintained by the individual's tenacious self-assertion, but under the conditions of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and deconstruction, the rigid self-identity of the "I" can no longer be sustained, leading to a reevaluation of the self and its relationship with difference.

- Prior to nihilism and deconstruction, metaphysics was characterized by the metaphysics of presence, where the primary function of the human mind was to make being, structure, and self present, and self-difference was forgotten, causing difference to appear as an external force.

- The emergence of nihilism and deconstruction reveals that difference is actually an internal principle of the movement of self-difference, and that difference is the ground of identity, while nothingness is the ground of being, a concept that was already explored in structuralism.

- Differential semiotics, as seen in the works of [Saussure](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and Barthes, implies that the self-identical mind can be explained in terms of relations within a network of structures, and that signification exists only in the differential relation, leading to the question of where being resides if not in difference.

## The Western and Eastern Approaches to Understanding Holistic Systems

- The metaphysics of substance is no longer viable, and concepts like "blue" can only be defined in relation to certain criteria, as a sign of something else, in the chain of signifiers, highlighting the excessive formalization and scientific specialization that has led to the completion of philosophy.

- Heidegger believed that the development of philosophy into independent sciences is the legitimate completion of philosophy, which is achieved through the [deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) of structure and the [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) of meaning, as found in the differential semiotics of postmodernism.

- The concept of differential semiotics is pure form, where the signified of a signifier is another signifier, and meaning does not exist, but rather a chain of signifiers, a idea that was explored by [Roland Barthes](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), who introduced the concept of the empty sign or sign degree zero to emancipate signifiers from the domination of the ultimate signified.

- Barthes' work, particularly his book L'empire des signes, reveals that the sign is a fracture that only ever opens onto the face of another sign, expressing the wisdom of the Buddhist monk, that there is no essence, only an essential emptiness, highlighting the true nihilism of semiotics, where the sign is the fracture of meaning, the abyss of nihility, and the chasm of difference.

- The concept of "there is no essence, only an essential emptiness" is discussed in relation to the semiotics of difference, which implies the opening up of pure possibility, and this idea is linked to the work of Roland Barthes and the collapse of the Western construction of meaning.

## The Influence of Heidegger's Philosophy on Japanese Thought

- The collapse of the Western construction of meaning is also associated with the end of the metaphysics of subjectivity, where the concept of the "transcendental ego" is no longer necessary, and structuralists like Karatani argue that the excess beyond human creation can be lumped into structure through the concept of "zero".

- Karatani's discussion of the "zero degree" of signification is connected to [Japan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), which is seen as a metaphysical locus of difference, where deconstructive forces are constantly at work, and the concept of "zero" has its historical origins in the spiritual Orient, specifically in the Buddhist concept of emptiness, or Śûnyatâ.

- The concept of the zero sign is traced back to the work of [Saussure](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and Jakobson, and Lévi-Strauss identified it as a floating signifier, but Karatani argues that this zero sign guarantees the structurality of the structure and exists as a proxy for God or the transcendental ego.

- Karatani draws comparisons between Christianity in the West and [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) in the East, highlighting the idea that the transcendental other is regarded as a representation of absolute emptiness, and that this discourse replaces the proposition that it is God who makes with the idea that it is emptiness that makes.

- The discussion also touches on the idea that European [existentialism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) replaced the "transcendental signifier" with "nothingness" as the transcendental guarantee of its nihilist existence, and that the differential chain of signifiers is embedded or anchored into nothingness by the will-to-architecture, in the form of the ultimate signifier.

## The Concept of 'Nothingness' and Its Significance in Japanese Philosophy

- The zero sign functions as a kind of "negation of absence" that guarantees the victory of structure over the deconstructive urge, even in the absence of God or the transcendental Ego, and this idea is linked to the critique of Western subjectivity by Japanese thinkers like Nishida and Nishitani, who argued that substituting Nothingness for the Subject is a flawed approach.

- The philosopher Karatani is analyzing the Western "will to architecture" and its manifestation in various structures and systems, including semiotics, language, architecture, philosophy, structuralism, mathematics, and logic, to understand how they attempt to stabilize differential relations to a fixed being, but ultimately self-deconstruct.

- Karatani, like Derrida, celebrates the movement of self-differentiation as the source of life and dynamism, arguing that self-referential formal systems are dynamic due to incessant internal slippage and cannot maintain a definite meta-level or center.

- In mathematics, Karatani cites Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem as an example of how the field is powered by its nonsubstantiality, and that its development is driven by its own lack of foundation, which is a concept that resonates with the Japanese perspective on reality as nonsubstantial.

- Karatani's main point is that efforts at formalization and foundationalism, such as those by Gödel, Descartes, or [Husserl](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), ultimately falter and degenerate into self-referential paradoxality, revealing the contradictions of the "will to architecture" that seeks to build structures on difference.

## The Critique of Western Metaphysics and Its Implications

- Karatani draws on Heidegger's criticism of Western metaphysics of substance, quoting him as saying that Being is abyssal, offering no ground or basis for building, and that it is pure groundlessness and nothingness.

- Heidegger's perspective, which emphasizes the emptiness and universality of Being, is seen by Karatani as a radicalization of Husserlian apodictic certainty, and his non-dual perspective, with its emphasis on pure Being as the horizon of truth, appeals to Karatani as a system without a center, a system of pure difference.

- Karatani also notes that Heidegger's approach, which prioritizes silence and non-response, is reminiscent of Japanese ideas, and that Heidegger's confrontation with Husserl's formal transcendental logic of the ego is similar to Gödel's challenge to Russell's mathematical foundationalism.

- According to Karatani, any system is a system of ungrounded difference, where language is self-referential and devoid of a base and center, similar to a self-differential formal system.

- Karatani agrees with Althusser's point of view that the history of philosophy appears as a kind of game for nothing, where nothing really happens, but this does not mean that philosophy is unreal, rather it is a place where nothingness comes into self-awareness and focus as Being-Nothingness.

## The Concept of 'Being-as-Nothingness' and Its Significance

- The emphasis on difference and [deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) in Karatani's work owes a lot to the Japanese emphasis on life's transience, the world's emptiness, and being's nothingness, which is a key aspect of his general deconstructive theory.

- Karatani's theories on the economy conform to his general deconstructive theory, where he reads Marx as deconstructing traditional economic theory and Kant as deconstructing Cartesian transcendental egoism, presenting Kant as an early deconstructionist.

- In Karatani's reading, the economy is a relational system with innumerable centers coexisting without a transcendental center, where market exchange is pure difference and the value of commodities can only be expressed relatively, with no single center or base to the system.

- Karatani sees Marxism as a response to the crisis of formalization, where Marx realized the absence of a foundation in economics, and this discussion is continued in his later book, "Transcritique: On Kant and Marx", which presents his most interesting political and economic-theoretical work.

- The concept of difference and deconstruction is central to Karatani's work, where he argues that any commodity can replace any other as the frame of reference, and any commodity can appear as the solid foundation of the monetary system, but ultimately there is no single center or base to the system, just an infinite regress of signifiers signifying other signifiers.

## The Intercultural Dialogue Between Eastern and Western Philosophies

- The discussion revolves around Karatani's political economy and social theory, which is informed by his dialogue on nothingness, and how he appropriates Western philosophy to undermine it by deconstructing various aspects of Western culture and philosophy.

- Karatani's position is that only [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and [deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) can create a turbulence that lifts the veil of illusion, resulting in a dis-placed and un-grounded world of pure difference, where being is understood as difference and difference is understood as nothingness.

- The text also introduces Nishitani Keiji's work, particularly his book "The Self-Overcoming of Nihilism", which provides a critical intervention into Western history and aims to explain the development of [existentialism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) as nihilism or the self-overcoming of nihilism.

- Nishitani's central idea is the "standpoint of emptiness" (kû no tachiba), which is elaborated in his book "Religion and Nothingness", and his work is considered important for East-West dialogue, as it touches on the essence of Western philosophy and deconstructs it from within.

- Nishitani's approach to studying nihilism is to do so nihilistically, meaning that one must be affected by its grasp and attend rigorously to the project, getting rid of false distinctions between the subject and the object, and between the philosopher and their philosophy.

## The Concept of Nihilism and Its Self-Overcoming

- The text also mentions other key figures, such as Nishida Kitarô, Tanabe, Abe Masao, and Ueda Shizuteru, who are important for understanding the [Kyoto school](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) philosophers and their perspectives on [Zen](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), which are considered foundational to Japanese philosophy.

- The discussion highlights the importance of understanding the ontological underpinnings that shape Western society, psychology, philosophy, and culture, and how Karatani's and Nishitani's work can help reveal these underlying metaphysics and create a new understanding of the world.

- The concept of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is being examined from a distance, creating a self-division between the observing self and the self being observed, which is a criticism of Western transcendental subjectivity from an Eastern or Buddhist perspective.

- The topic of the "divided self" or split subjectivity emerges as an important theme in the discussion of Western nihilism, particularly in the context of Laing's critique of Western psychiatry and the interstice of psychology and philosophy.

- Nihilism is seen as a psychological challenge and a philosophical dilemma, involving the annihilation of the ground of the psyche, leading to self-doubt, despair, and a problematization of the self, as stated by Nishitani, who views nihilism as a problem that arises when the self becomes a problem.

## The Western and Eastern Perspectives on Nothingness

- The Western conception of the Self as a psychological entity is being questioned, and the epistemological breakdown of the observing self's standpoint is leading to a reevaluation of the dualistic world-view and the notion of existence.

- Nishitani's concept of the "Self-Overcoming of [Nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined)" refers to the historical process of self-[deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and self-understanding of being as nothingness, which developed from the 19th century nihilists to the 20th century existentialists.

- Nishitani's perspective on Western history is unique and distinctly "Eastern", as he views [Europe](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) from the perspective of an Asian scholar, and believes that the concept of nihilism is a historical concept that arose in Europe and is now a global issue, affecting [Japan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and other cultures that have been influenced by European culture.

- The breakdown of the Cartesian-Christian self-reflective transcendental viewpoint is seen as a key aspect of nihilism, where the subject becomes unable to differentiate themselves from themselves as an object, leading to a loss of the sense of a separate and substantial self.

- The idea of the "self-ground-existence" triad is central to Nishitani's concept of nihilism, where the self becomes problematic when the ground of its existence becomes a problem, leading to a revelation of the "ontological difference" between Reality and Appearance, and a deconstructive light is shed on everything that was once considered stable and secure.

## The Concept of 'Will to Architecture' and Its Relation to Western Culture

- The Western epistemology's subject-object structure collapses into a pure Will-to-Power, where the subject is unselfdifferentiated and absolutely free, as described by Nietzsche and Sartre, who stated that man is condemned to be free.

- The traditional Western transcendental egoism, as seen in the works of Descartes, Kant, and [Husserl](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), follows the logic of "Subject > S1 & S2", where the subject is divided into two subjects, S1 (the transcendental ego) and S2 (our ordinary self-awareness), with S1 looking down upon S2 from a higher perspective.

- This division is characterized by a sense of dissociation, where the self withdraws into itself and out of the body, leading to feelings of estrangement and derealization, as described by [R.D. Laing](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) in the context of schizophrenia, but also applicable to Cartesian dualism.

- The fundamental division in Western dualism is not between a soul and a body, but between Self-as-Subject (S1) and Self-as-Object (S2/O), which is the basis for the distinction between one's true self and ordinary self, and between oneself and one's body.

- According to Nishitani, Western man clings to having two separate selves, the questioning self and the self that is questioned, which is similar to the Divided Self of the schizophrenic, as described by R.D. Laing, and this self-division appears illusory when the ground of being is missing, as stated by Nietzsche's idea that "God is dead".

## The Deconstruction of Western Metaphysics

- The state of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is the conclusion of Western metaphysics, compelling the re-evaluation of the ground of being, and leading to the self becoming one, as described by Nishitani, who interprets the Western existentialist-nihilist self in a quasi-Buddhist manner, revealing the impossibility and groundlessness of all Subject-Object distinction.

- Nishitani's idea is that the Western existentialist-nihilist self, as seen in the works of Heidegger and Sartre, brings about the end and self-overcoming of the history of epistemological dualism, by revealing the impossibility of all Subject-Object distinction, which is a decisively Eastern intervention into European thought.

- The philosopher Nishitani's analysis combines Eastern and Western thought to explore the turn to nihilism in Western philosophy, specifically focusing on the period between 1850 and 1950, starting with [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), who was one of the first philosophers to be called a nihilist.

- Schopenhauer's philosophy is characterized as a mixture of Christian morality and Buddhist nirvana, where he equates the Kantian "thing-in-itself" with the "will to life" that appears as desire in individual things, leading to profound dissatisfaction and the understanding that life is essentially suffering.

- By renouncing the will and all things of the phenomenal world, Schopenhauer achieves "negative emancipation", which allows for the understanding of the essentially void nature of existence, and his ethics are seen as an odd mixture of Christian morality and Buddhist nirvana.

## The Concept of 'Zero Sign' and Its Significance

- Nishitani also explores Schopenhauer's concept of boredom as a malady of the will, where boredom is insight into the void nature of existence and the insubstantiality of all things, and people try to escape from this fact by killing time, highlighting the theme of transience and the impermanence of life.

- The philosopher [Kierkegaard](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is also discussed, who wrote disapprovingly of boredom, calling it "the root of all evil", and saw it as a natural birth condition of human beings, leading to a metaphysics of boredom where nothing is fun, new, or lasting, and [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is the final culmination of this metaphysics.

- The concept of boredom is linked to the idea of inauthenticity, where the bored individual is insecure, numb, and void, and this theme is later explored by philosophers such as Heidegger and Sartre, who use anxiety and nausea as a means of breaking through boredom and achieving authenticity.

- Nishitani's analysis is influenced by his Japanese cultural background, particularly the concept of mono no aware, which emphasizes the transience and impermanence of life, and this perspective allows him to highlight the importance of focusing on the present moment and adopting an aestheticizing attitude towards life.

- The concept of nothingness in Western [existentialism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is characterized as a vertiginous abyss that evokes anxiety, nausea, and nervousness, prompting individuals to move towards self-overcoming nihilism to escape boredom and find meaning in life.

## Karatani's Critique of Western Philosophy

- Existentialist thinkers like [Kierkegaard](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and Schopenhauer write about [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) through irony, tragedy, and comedy, sharing the idea that life is inherently without meaning, and that boredom is a mark of inauthenticity, with the average and normal being considered "the root of all evil".

- The existentialist aim is to break through the abyss of nothingness and embrace life's groundlessness and transience, using irony and anxiety to prompt the self to look into the abyss and become selfish through its own freedom and strength, ultimately finding itself guilty and standing before a higher power in a state of nihilistic despair.

- This theme of anxiety and despair as a medium of redemption is a typically Christian idea that has been inherited by later existentialist thinkers, including Heidegger, Sartre, and Camus, despite their atheism, making existentialism a form of atheistic Christianity for the nihilistic literati.

- The concept of nothingness is seen as an empty savior in a spiritually void age, where nothing has value, and the will becomes equated with self-contradiction, prompting the existentialist philosopher to seek transcendental liberation through self-awareness of their state of fallenness and boredom.

- However, this project is considered characteristically Western and fundamentally mistaken, as the subject fails to nullify its egoistic attachment to life and the concept of being, instead seeking to attach itself to something, whether spirituality, religion, or philosophy, and ultimately finding liberation only in physical death.

## Nishitani's Concept of 'Standpoint of Emptiness'

- The existentialist abyss is considered unreachable because it is demarcated by death, and even Heidegger's concept of Dasein as a being-towards-death only allows for an imperfect abiding in the presence of nothingness, making full spiritual salvation and liberation possible only after death.

- The philosopher Heidegger did not believe in complete liberation in the present moment, as suggested by [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), and instead thought that the body and mind are dualistically split until death, which can only be temporarily overcome through meditation.

- According to Heidegger's views, as influenced by his Christian background, death is what ultimately "liberates" the soul, but at the cost of the body, and this dualism is driven by the fear of unity and the collapse of distinctions, particularly the fear of dying.

- The existentialist quest, as seen in the works of Heidegger, [Kierkegaard](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), and Sartre, is a painful and potentially dangerous pursuit of transcendence, which can only be achieved by torturing the body into transcendental receptivity or waiting for a majestic vision of trembling anxiety, often associated with the gates of death or heaven.

- Heidegger's philosophy, despite being read atheistically and materialistically by some, still operates within the parameters of his Christian background, as evident in his statement that "only a God can save us now" and his division of existence into "authentic" and "inauthentic" modes.

## The Kyoto School Philosophers and Their Perspectives

- [Existentialism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), as a meeting point of religiosity and secularism, spiritualism and materialism, has failed to denounce the connection between reality and fallenness, instead embracing the concept of "original sin" as the highest gift and burden of authentic existence, where nothingness is regarded as an abyss that stands across from or under us, symbolizing the negation of life and the principle of destructive annihilation.

- The concept of nothingness, as developed in existentialism and [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), has evolved through various permutations, influencing Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of semiotics, difference, and postmodern nihilism, as seen in the works of [Saussure](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), Derrida, and Kristeva, where nothingness is regarded as a kind of "absence in the presence" or "present absence".

- The deconstructive-semiotic-linguistic turn, which began with Nietzsche, has shaped 20th-century philosophy away from existentialism and idealism, but still shares with existentialism a peculiar attitude towards nothingness as difference, ultimately leading to the "actualized nihilism" of postmodernism, where the premise of equating difference with otherness has never been questioned, and nothingness is still perceived as being "out there" somewhere.

- The Western idealism perspective is rooted in the "logocentric" tradition, where the logos, voice, speech, reason, text, reigns supreme, and difference is conceived as an argumentative expansion or self-annihilation that occurs outside the subject, leading to the subject being transcendentally dispatched into the intertextual space of floating signifiers.

- This perspective is reflected in the ideas of Habermas's fully transparent communicative discourse and the Enlightenment ideal of democratic pluralism, where the human being is treated as a subject, rather than as an experience of subject-object duality, and is measured in opposition to other opinions, voices, and points of view.

## The Concept of Nihilism and Its Implications

- The human subject is seen as the ground of positioning, with the self-expressive self-centring of a human voice, and is rarely allowed the luxury of self-othering, or being recognized as absolute nothingness, due to being delimited by death and difference.

- The Western perspective offers two methods for contextualizing thought: affirming the self-limiting projectuality of a mortal's being-in-the-worldness, or negating all directionality of the will and responsibility of the subject in favor of a trans-personal, deconstructive hermeneutics of limitless otherness, both of which leave the relationship between the thinker and the thought unexamined.

- In contrast, the Eastern mind, as exemplified by traditional Japanese philosophy, fully internalizes nothingness as a part of life, and recognizes a difference between physical death and ego-death, which is a metaphysical, rather than psychological, difference in outlook.

- The Eastern perspective values silence and emptiness, whereas the Western mind is limited by a spiritualized fear of death, and sees inactivity as the realm of death, making it difficult for the Western mind to accept the positive value of silence.

- The ideas of philosophers such as William James, Nishida Kitarô, and Socrates are referenced, with Socrates' statement that the unexamined life is not worth living highlighting the importance of examining the relationship between the thinker and the thought.

## The Western and Eastern Approaches to Understanding Holistic Systems

- The concept of time and existence is explored in the context of Heidegger's philosophy, particularly in his work Sein und Zeit, where the "anxiety"-effect pulls human beings towards the future, and Dasein temporalizes without annihilating the flow of time.

- Heidegger's ideas are compared to Japanese mono no aware aesthetics and Buddhist philosophy, which views the self as an illusion and self-preservation as a key factor in the creation of illusions, whereas Heidegger sees the grasping for a ground of being as a lifelong journey that ends in physical death.

- In Western philosophy, from [Plato](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) to Derrida, the end of thought is often seen as the end of life, and death is viewed as the resolution of self-contradictions, with life being a journey and not the starting point.

- The role of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is examined, with nothingness being equated with death and absence, and the abyss remaining external to human experience, as seen in the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Kant, who viewed the "thing-in-itself" as unreachable and mysterious.

- The Buddhist perspective is presented as a counterpoint, where nothingness is seen as the ultimate reality, and the self is viewed as an illusion, with the conclusion that Western metaphysics fails to integrate the self and the world, and that the logical conclusion of Western metaphysics is also the starting point of [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined).

## The Influence of Heidegger's Philosophy on Japanese Thought

- Various philosophers, including Nietzsche, [Kierkegaard](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), and Sartre, are mentioned as examples of thinkers who grappled with the concept of nihilism, but failed to move beyond it, with Nietzsche seeing the abyss as a promise, Kierkegaard taking a leap of faith, and Sartre viewing the world as cold and absurd, highlighting the limitations of Western metaphysics in addressing the question of nothingness and the self.

- The existentialists were unable to experience nothingness as a positive experience because they associated it with the powers of death, rather than the powers of life, which led them to face death, dogma, madness, or absurdity when confronted with the abyss of nothingness.

- In contrast, Eastern philosophers, such as those in the Buddhist tradition, see nothingness as a source of life and power, with the concept of emptiness being a fundamental principle in Eastern metaphysics, where the goal of practice is to end thought and achieve a state of total "oneness" or "nothingness".

- The Western approach to [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is characterized by the isolation of the self in relation to nothingness, resulting in a split between the subject and object, and a fear of death, which is reflected in the concept of the "Divided Self" as described by [R.D. Laing](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined).

- This self-splitting and self-alienation have their roots in the religious act of externalizing the internal, as analyzed by Nishitani, and are also seen in the critiques of religion by philosophers such as [Ludwig Feuerbach](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and [Karl Marx](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), who argue that the concept of a supreme being is a result of idealizing human nature and objectifying it as a personal god.

## The Concept of 'Nothingness' and Its Significance in Japanese Philosophy

- The idea of nothingness as a kind of "supreme essence" that the individual depends on is seen as analogous to the concept of God, with nothingness being the empty throne of God in an age where "God is dead", and this self-splitting and self-contradiction of the foundation are at the heart of the problematics of nihilism.

- The question remains whether the Western and Eastern outlooks on nihilism can be reconciled and recontextualized in the world of ideas, with nihilism potentially being both an acute inflammation of the chronic problem of self-splitting and a sign of the healing process to come, as it takes this split seriously and lives it through.

- The concept of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) raises important questions about the split between the subject and the object, the soul and the ego, and religion and the secular world, and how to dissolve this self-division into a new wholeness based on a nihilistic foundation.

- Philosophers such as Marx and Feuerbach, as religious materialists and progressives, sought to collapse the two worlds into one, the secular world, by attributing self-contradictions and alienation to religion and class struggle, and proposing enlightened secularism as the solution.

- However, according to Nishitani, Marx's thought, which insisted on having overcome nihilism, actually represented a form of modern nihilism, characterized by fundamentalist materialism and a desire to eradicate false consciousness engendered by religion and capitalism.

## The Critique of Western Metaphysics and Its Implications

- Nishitani agrees with Nietzsche's assessment that socialism is a kind of modern nihilism, and claims that empirically, socialism appeared in the form of nihilism in Russia, where atheism became the new religion and socialism became the new opiate for the masses.

- The experience of nothingness and disillusionment with religious and secular authority led to the development of a new atheist, socialist, and secularist self-consciousness in [Europe](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), which was also exported to [Japan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), particularly during the Meiji era and post-War period.

- Nishitani's concept of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is not limited to Western philosophy, but is also relevant to Japanese thought, and he views nihilism as a necessary stage in Western philosophy's search for a new world order, rather than simply a negative phenomenon.

- The author emphasizes that criticizing Western philosophy does not undermine the value of thinkers such as Nietzsche and Nishitani, but rather sheds light on the working assumptions and background conditions of their philosophy, which continues to have enduring value.

- The Western thinkers of [existentialism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) were moving in the right direction, but they were coming from a specific historical context and undergoing a process that can be called the "self-overcoming of nihilism", which involves the erosion of the principles of highest value and truth, as described by Nietzsche as the "collapse of cosmological values".

## The Concept of 'Being-as-Nothingness' and Its Significance

- This process, also referred to as "radical nihilism" by Nishitani, means the self-reflection of the collapse of the "architecture" of the ages, the undermining of the edifice of metaphysical certainty and spiritual guidance, and is characterized by the idea that "God is Dead", leaving a vacant "seat" or "throne" of the Highest Being.

- The absence of a higher power and the collapse of traditional metaphysical certainty have led to a state of nihility, where individuals are faced with the burden of freedom and the compulsion to become something, namely to become themselves, as Sartre describes freedom as "self-being, as continued self-creation".

- This state of nihility creates anxiety and a sense of void, as individuals are drawn into nothingness and experience a spiritual vacuum, which is the flip-side of pluralism and relativism, and is characterized by the impossibility of choice, where "everything and nothing" is possible, because nothing is guaranteed and everything is permitted.

- The experience of this spiritual vacuum is similar to the experience of the schizophrenic individual, as described by Laing, where the sense of being able to do anything and the feeling of possessing everything exist side by side with a feeling of impotence and emptiness, and is a result of the abyss of choice provided by modernity, which can lead to a schizophrenic self-split.

- The idea that Being must be grounded is a product of the Western metaphysical mind, but it is possible to argue that Being does not have to be grounded, and that truth does not have to be set in stone, and that experience does not require ideological permission, as emphasized by thinkers such as Walter Benjamin and the Frankfurt school, who have written about commodity fetishism, but less about ideology fetishism.

## The Intercultural Dialogue Between Eastern and Western Philosophies

- Ultimately, the value of silence and the value of groundlessness can only be realized when the individual is able to let go of the need for a higher power and traditional metaphysical certainty, and is able to embrace the freedom and uncertainty of existence, as described by existentialists, artists, and other individuals who have been able to find meaning and purpose in a post-metaphysical world.

- The concept of "nothingness" and "absence" is explored in the context of the movie Mulholland Drive, where the Western mind tries to overcompensate for the threat of silence by empty words, leading to an excess of structure and appearance.

- The existential nihilist, in facing nothingness, fetishizes being and chooses the "authentic" life as a cure for [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), which becomes something to fight for and shape, with nothingness being the means of achieving this transcendental power.

- According to Nietzsche, Christianity leads to "the negation of life" and a kind of "pessimism of weakness" evinced by "the religion of pity", which is a major instrument of the heightening of décadence, and he makes the connection from Christianity to modern day nihilism directly by saying that "pity is the praxis of nihilism".

- Nietzsche criticizes Christianity for encouraging a "denaturalized naturalness, a life that tortures itself", and also attacks Schopenhauer, who he sees as a pseudo-Christian, for considering pity a virtue, although Schopenhauer's concept of compassion was likely appropriated from Indian and Buddhist sources.

## The Concept of Nihilism and Its Self-Overcoming

- The "death of god" has heralded an age of secular nihilism, and radical nihilists, in seeking to overturn all existing values, are fulfilling and consummating "the spirit of Christianity", with thinkers like [Kierkegaard](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and other existentialists and radical nihilists self-consciously seeking to oppose all pre-existing values.

- Nietzsche believes that the self-[deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) of the architecture of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) in the post-Christian era corresponds to the philosophical history of [existentialism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and the "crisis" of European-Western individualism, and that the revaluation of all values is already at work at the very beginnings of nihilism, driven by the sincerity cultivated by Christianity, which ultimately leads to atheism being born out of self-doubting sincerity.

- The text discusses the concept of nihilism and its impact on Western ideas, where truths become lies and sincerity becomes insincerity, leading to a landscape of ruins with abandoned buildings and derelict churches, symbolizing the decline of traditional values and the death of God.

- The nihilist existentialists, such as Sartre and Heidegger, navigated this landscape, and their pessimism is an understandable attitude given the circumstances, while nihilists like [Max Stirner](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and [Jacques Lacan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) contributed to the redefinition of the Western self as an autonomous ego grounded on nothing outside itself.

- Max Stirner's philosophy, as expressed in his statement "Ich hab' mein' Sach' auf Nichts gestellt" (I have founded my affair on nothing), is seen as a crystallization of the inverted will to architecture, where nothingness is viewed as a positive attribute of the free self, leading to egoism and individualism.

## The Western and Eastern Perspectives on Nothingness

- The concept of nothingness is explored in two ways: as the absence of presence or the presence of absence, and in both cases, it remains outside of the self, outside of the mind, and outside its domain of self-identity, with the Western mind seeing nothingness as an externalized, substantialized negative principle of the universe.

- The self-reflective, internal quest towards the depths of the ego has led to the development of Freudian psychoanalysis and its concept of the unconscious, which divides man into two, as stated by Lacan, and has also influenced the work of [R.D. Laing](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), who points out the self-splitting of the human mind and the limitations of modern psychotherapy in addressing this issue.

- The text concludes that the great thinkers of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) have provided tools for self-analyzing and self-diagnosing nihilism, but not for healing the split, and that the concept of a unitary whole is impossible or undesirable in modern psychology and philosophy, with the self being seen as already split into different factions or fragments.

- The philosophers discussed, including Stirner and Lacan, are considered "great metaphysical spirits" who have uncovered the lack of foundations in all constructions and concepts, revealing the difference of the self with itself and the non-self-identity of the Self.

- According to [Max Stirner](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), the Self is its own cause and end, and in being everything to itself, it is "the nothing of all else", justifying his egoism by setting his concern solely on himself, similar to how God and Humanity are self-justifying.

## The Concept of 'Will to Architecture' and Its Relation to Western Culture

- The Western approach to nothingness is seen as an "outside" force of differentiation, where the Self is constantly being moved by the empty vacuum of metaphysical self-difference, but never as the unity of the mover and the moved.

- The concept of egoism, as defended by Stirner, is justified because the individual is never nothing to themselves, but rather "am my all", highlighting the dialectical tension of self-contradiction inherent in any self-identity that self-grounds.

- The text also touches on the idea that pure and absolute self-affirmation is impossible, and that self-negation and doubt are inherent in any affirmation of belief, citing examples such as Christians who may not truly believe in private, and atheists who may still harbor doubts.

- The history of the Self reveals the "groundless ground" of Western "I-hood", leading to a self-defensive self-overcoming of its vertigo, and the nihilist Self begins this process, highlighting the self-contradictory nature of the Western post-Christian "Cogito".

- The philosopher Nishitani is quoted, and the ideas of Kant are also referenced, demonstrating the influence of various philosophical perspectives on the discussion of the Self and nothingness.

## The Deconstruction of Western Metaphysics

- The text also mentions an interview with [Jacques Lacan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), and the diaries of Mother Theresa, providing additional context and examples to support the arguments presented.

- The concept of Stirner's egoism is discussed as an attempt to heal the division of the self, where the self is split into the earthly "self" and the heavenly "spirit", and Stirner aims to collapse the spiritual dimension down to earth to create a secular and undivided Self.

- This secular Self is based on "nothing", but not in the sense of a void, rather a creative nothing that allows the individual to create everything, and this nothingness is the foundation of all [deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) of authority, including morality, state authority, and other forms of external meaning.

- Stirner's philosophy emphasizes the unity of the ego and the creative nothing, where the individual regards himself as "unique" and uniquely empty of all determinants, and freedom from authority is the ground of individuality as such, with individuals standing on "nothing".

- The text also references Nishitani's interpretation of Stirner's ideas, highlighting the concept of the egoist basing himself on absolute "nothing", and the hollowness and nihility of state authority being directly proportional to the unlimited powers and potencies of the creative ego.

## The Concept of 'Zero Sign' and Its Significance

- In contrast to Stirner's egoism, existentialist philosophy, as represented by Heidegger and Sartre, emphasizes "self-doubt", "despair", and "helplessness", and Heidegger's concept of "ontological difference" between Being and beings is highlighted as a key aspect of his existentialist philosophy.

- The text also touches on the idea that European [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), roughly between Feuerbach and Heidegger, involves the self coming face to face with Nothingness as the site where opposites meet and are created, and Nothingness is seen as the plenum of difference, highlighting the complex and nuanced nature of the self and its relationship to authority and meaning.

- The concept of nothingness is associated with the plenum of sameness and oneness, and is characterized by the transcendental dialectics of affirmation and negation, containing both limitless hope and despair, as described by Nishitani.

- Traditional metaphysics, from Aristotle to Kant, has typically involved setting the world up as an object of contemplation, resulting in the legacy of epistemological dualism and the birth of the "divided self", a concept that has been criticized by philosophers such as Heidegger and Nishitani.

- Heidegger's philosophy attempts to break free from the subject-object distinction through his Dasein analysis, but his work must be carefully examined in this regard, as he relies on the concept of Death to account for human freedom as the ground of nothingness, and sees nothingness as a kind of transcendental impossibility.

## Karatani's Critique of Western Philosophy

- Nishitani criticizes the strategy of self-reflection in Western philosophy, arguing that it constitutes a transcendental artifice that is substituted for real experience, and his work can be compared to that of Richard Rorty, who has written an extensive critique of the "representationalist" bias in Western idealistic philosophy.

- Heidegger's concept of Death is closely tied to the concept of nothingness, as it is seen as a means of individualizing human existence and disclosing the being of human being, and his philosophy is characterized by an interesting parallelism between death and nothingness.

- The state of "anxiety" is a fundamental mood in Heidegger's philosophy, as it is seen as a response to the nothingness that underlies human existence, and this attitude is also described in psychiatry as a self-protective mechanism, as individuals defend themselves against the experience of ego-loss and the ineffable.

- The Western person, and possibly the Eastern person as well, attaches to their ego in day-to-day life, and reacts violently when faced with the ineffable, the nameless, the transpersonal, the empty, and the void, as described by philosophers such as Laing.

- The concept of the void, or nothingness, is perceived as a form of violence against the ego, and philosophers like Heidegger have reacted to this violence with a counter-violent approach, distinguishing him from Buddhist and Japanese [Zen](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) master ideologies.

## Nishitani's Concept of 'Standpoint of Emptiness'

- Heidegger's philosophy operates within the metaphysical tradition of "God is Dead", where the void represents a life-negating principle of deprivation and despair, and he never achieved the state of satori, or full enlightenment, but rather a partial enlightenment, or kenshô.

- Heidegger's most Buddhist insight is the concept that "Nothing itself nothings", but he still views nothingness as an auxiliary or satellite constellation of Being, rather than a direct path to enlightenment, and his idea of Dasein, or self-awareness, is a struggle of Being over Nothing.

- The self-awareness of Dasein is characterized by a state of "fallenness" or imperfection, and a non-relation to itself, which is not yet a fully self-empowered [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), but rather a state of searching, grasping, and reaching for transcendence.

- According to Heidegger, authenticity can only be reached from a standpoint of self-alienation, and anxiety is seen as a catalyst for this process, as it allows human beings to confront the possibility of their own death and the nothingness that lies ahead.

- In contrast, Japanese scholars like Nishitani perceive Heidegger's approach as a form of "Will to Architecture" or attachment to the self, which is seen as a Western symptom, and instead advocate for a non-judgmental and non-attached approach to nothingness and the self.

## The Kyoto School Philosophers and Their Perspectives

- Nishitani's perspective is characterized by a sense of non-judgmental superiority towards Western philosophers, and he critiques the idea of assuming a standpoint of self-overcoming, instead emphasizing the importance of embracing nothingness and the impermanence of all things.

- The concept of Western [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is discussed, with the idea that it lacks the means to self-deconstruct without violence or mental exertion, and that this is equivalent to saying it cannot deconstruct without attachment to the self.

- According to [R.D. Laing](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), Western psychology and various existential philosophies agree that the egoic experience is a preliminary illusion, and that ego-loss is not inherently pathological, but rather a necessary step towards redemption.

- The idea of "attachment to the self" is clarified through the concept of "Will to Power" as described by Nietzsche, and "Will to Architecture" as renamed by Karatani, which refers to the fundamental drive to create and maintain a sense of self.

- Nishitani's reading of [Kierkegaard](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) suggests that nihilism can only be overcome by experiencing it to the utmost, and that this process is a paradigm for understanding nihilism in general, with existentialists like Kierkegaard and Heidegger writing about this process from the perspective of nihilism itself.

## The Concept of Nihilism and Its Implications

- The difference between Western [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and Buddhist emptiness is highlighted, with Western nihilism being characterized by an attachment to the self, as seen in Sartre's individualistic [existentialism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), where one must continually create oneself to maintain a sense of self within nothing.

- This attachment to the self is seen as a form of desire that contradicts itself when it realizes it has no ground to speak of, leading to a self-contradiction that constitutes a way of being in which the self is its own prison, as described by Sartre as being "condemned to be free".

- Nishitani concludes that Sartre's concept of "Existence" retains a sense of attachment to the self, and that the "nothingness" he speaks of remains a nothingness to which the self is attached, preventing true freedom and the experience of emptiness.

- The idea is presented that as long as we see nothingness as a "thing" or an attachment to the self, we will never experience its emptiness, and that true freedom can only be achieved by letting go of this attachment and embracing the unity of [being and nothingness](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined).

- The concept of reaffirming the identity of the self and the non-identity of contradiction is considered a radical idea, as it allows for a deeper understanding of the point of view of emptiness in [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), which is interpreted in [Zen](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) as "calm" acceptance, and is rooted in the idea that being is self-identical and negates difference.

## The Western and Eastern Approaches to Understanding Holistic Systems

- The integration of Nothingness into Being is a key concept, as it opens up the illusory nature of Being and the ungraspable nature of Nothingness, allowing for a non-dualistic understanding of the world, which is referred to as the "event horizon" of the "world-I", a concept that is related to the idea of "Dasein" in Heidegger's philosophy.

- The intersection of Buddhism and Western "idealist" philosophies, such as those of Kant, Schelling, and Hegel, has been a significant area of study, particularly in [Japan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), where thinkers like Inoue Enryô and Nishitani have sought to combine Buddhist thought with Western philosophical ideas, creating a unique bridge between East and West.

- The influence of Heidegger's philosophy on Japanese thought has been particularly notable, with some Japanese thinkers, like Watsuji Tetsuro, criticizing Heidegger's emphasis on individuality and instead advocating for a more collective understanding of authenticity, which is realized through the annihilation of the self and the recognition of the importance of non-I.

- However, this emphasis on the collective and the rejection of individuality can have negative consequences, such as the trivialization of nothingness and the promotion of social fascism, as seen in the case of Buddhist-supported Imperial Japan, where the concept of emptiness was used to justify subservience and humility.

- In contrast, [Zen](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) offers a more nuanced understanding of the self, seeing it as an artificial construction that inhibits the Buddha vision and should be dissolved, but this idea can also be used to defend the state and attack non-conformity, highlighting the complex and often problematic relationship between individuality and collectivity in Japanese culture.

## The Influence of Heidegger's Philosophy on Japanese Thought

- The tradition of anti-individualism in [Japan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is deeply rooted in the country's institutional, political, and corporate structures, and can have severe psychological consequences, including the pressure to conform and the risk of public humiliation, which can lead to serious problems, such as suicide, emphasizing the need for a more balanced understanding of the relationship between individuality and collectivity.

- The concept of Oriental metaphysics, particularly the idea of emptiness, has its own history, power, and problems, and understanding it requires acknowledging its totalitarian nature, which can lead to the silencing of dissenting voices and a reduced tolerance for different opinions.

- The [Kyoto School](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) philosophers, including Nishitani, were politically allied with right-wing ideology, and Nishitani's criticism of Westernism sometimes led to a form of nationalism, as seen in his statement that Japan's culture and ways of thinking have become Europeanized, but the spiritual basis of [Europe](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) has not become Japan's spiritual basis.

- Nishitani believed that [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) had reached Japan, corroding its spiritual basis, and that Japanese people had been cut off from their tradition, leading to a loss of the spiritual self and a deep sense of hollowness, but he also proposed a program for the future, advocating for a new transformation of the spiritual culture of the Orient.

- Nishitani's ideas have been criticized for their nationalist overtones and his support for Japanese imperialism, which is comparable to Heidegger's support for the Hitler regime, and his uncritical reception of Heidegger's thought is considered politically suspect.

## The Concept of 'Nothingness' and Its Significance in Japanese Philosophy

- Despite these criticisms, Nishitani's work on the history of Western nihilism is considered one of the most impressive critiques of Western metaphysics written in the 20th century, and his appropriation of Heidegger and Nietzsche's ideas has resulted in a significant contribution to the field.

- The Japanese enthusiasm for Heidegger's thought has endured, and his ideas have found a familiar resonance among Japanese intellectuals, particularly in his redefinition of Being, which has led to a self-recognition and affinity with his work, making him the Western philosopher of choice among Japanese intellectuals.

- The concept of the Divided Self, as defined by [R.D. Laing](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), refers to an individual whose experience is split in two main ways: in their relation to the world and in their relation to themselves, which is reminiscent of the existential [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) that constitutes a similar split in the center of Western man.

- According to Laing, this split becomes acute in nihilism, where the self-understanding of the self-splitting of the Western "transcendental ego" perspective is transformed through the experience of an encounter with nothingness, leading to a strong sense of separation and alienation from the world and everyday consciousness.

- Laing's work, including "The Politics of Experience", highlights the psychological and spiritual state of modern man, where humanity is estranged from its authentic possibilities, and the ground is shifting, causing an almost unbelievable devastation of our experience due to the divorce of our experience from our behavior.

## The Critique of Western Metaphysics and Its Implications

- The author agrees with Laing's disapproval of modern psychiatry's handling of people labelled clinically insane, and believes that the way we treat the human body and mind showcases the brutality of Western conceptions of the mind and its denial of the sanctity of the body, which is mirrored by the nihilistic practices of institutional power and domination.

- [Nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is compared to a kind of mental illness of the collective, exemplifying many characteristics of 'madness', and the author suggests that combining the Western search for active self-differentiation with the Eastern attitude towards self-acceptance and holistic calm in the face of nothingness could be a way to navigate this madness.

- The author references the philosophical ideas of Heidegger, who saw Western metaphysics as the history of the self-splitting of "Being" into (ontic) "beings", and the self-forgetting of this self-splitting, in contrast to Oriental metaphysics, which prefers a holistic and unified starting point, as seen in Buddhist metaphysics, which preaches the self-presencing of the groundless ground of reality in the constant unity of Being-Nothingness.

- The Western and Eastern cultures have distinct approaches to understanding holistic systems and non-dual states, with Westerners often struggling to recognize these concepts and Easterners having trouble appreciating the value of self-differentiation and self-antagonizing for its own sake.

- The European tradition of self-splitting has led to significant advancements, such as human rights and political Enlightenment, but also negative consequences like cancer, schizophrenia, and Auschwitz, while the Oriental tradition of self-wholeness has given us spiritual and aesthetic Enlightenment, as well as social conservatism, irrationality, and unnecessary mysticism.

## The Concept of 'Being-as-Nothingness' and Its Significance

- In today's globalized world, no society is purely "European" or "Oriental", and cultures are permeated by "traces" of metaphysical inscriptions, with Japanese and Western metaphysical currents mixing freely through various forms of media and communication.

- Japanese movies, for example, often contain "Eastern metaphysical" elements, such as cinematographic holism, focus on transience, silence, and emptiness, and a lack of Self, while Hollywood movies contain many "Western metaphysical" elements, like constant dualism, focus on action and loudness, and a stable focus on the Self.

- According to Blocker and Starling, Japanese philosophy has made significant contributions to world philosophy by combining the themes of overcoming modernity and restoring holism, or nourishing non-nihilistic Emptiness, which is not originally "Japanese" but rather a synthesis of Eastern and Western philosophical elements.

- [Japan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) has played a mediating role in combining and synthesizing these threads, and its unique position at the crossroads of East and West has allowed it to make significant contributions to 20th-century philosophy, despite not being the origin of many of the philosophical elements it has incorporated.

- The consequence of "Western imperialism" has been the self-[deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) of Western metaphysics in the hands of the Oriental subaltern, revealing the West as simply a momentum of world spirit and not its final arbiter, and opening up the possibility of a fresh beginning in the perpetual cultural rejuvenation of life on this planet.

## The Intercultural Dialogue Between Eastern and Western Philosophies

- As the new millennium is defined by the forces of the resurgent Orient, it is essential to pay close attention to where the ironic dialectics of history will take us next, with Japan being a crucial intersection of multiple traditions and multiple histories, from [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) to Deconstruction, where East and West meet.

- The concept of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is explored in the context of Eastern and Western philosophies, where Japan is seen as a place where East and West converge, leading to the emergence of a new entity, the "Buddha-Christ", which represents the marriage of opposites and embodies the idea of "Being-as-Nothingness".

- The Western self is characterized as being in a state of "double bind", where it is both something, representing ground and meaning, and nothing, representing the absence of ground and meaning, leading to self-contradiction and self-transcendence, as described by Gregory Bateson and [R.D. Laing](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined).

- The Japanese perspective, as discussed by [Keiji Nishitani](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and [Kojin Karatani](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), offers a way to overcome the destructive aspects of nihilism by conceiving of Being as Nothingness and embracing pure openness without anxiety, providing a viewpoint of non-attachment to structure and sign.

- The works of Nishitani and Karatani are seen as radicalizations of Western processes of nihilism and [deconstruction](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined), drawing on European thinkers such as Nietzsche, Stirner, Sartre, Heidegger, and Derrida, and appropriating their ideas to create a counterpoint to Western metaphysics of substance.

## The Concept of Nihilism and Its Self-Overcoming

- The intercultural dialogue between Eastern and Western philosophies has led to a deepening and radicalization of the human mind's self-understanding as self-differing self-transcendence, as evident in the writings of Karatani, who notes that "the architectonic had always concealed the absence of its own foundation".

- The concept of absence and lack is perfected in the equation of Self = World, Ego = Alter, Substance = Void, and Being = Nothingness, highlighting the ultimate reality of nothingness and the impermanence of all things.

- The discussion is informed by a range of sources, including the works of Blocker, Starling, Heisig, Huhtinen, Laing, and Nishitani, among others, and is supplemented by extra articles and online resources, such as interviews with [Jacques Lacan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) and articles on Mother Theresa.
